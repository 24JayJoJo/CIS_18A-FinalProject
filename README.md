# CIS_18A-FinalProject



 The goal of the project is to create a text adventure / fighting simulator that follows the style of a tournament.
 We allow the user to create a character of varying stats:
     Hp: (1-100)
     Attack: (1-25)
     Defense: (1-25)
     Counter: (0-9
     ***THESE WILL BE THEIR STARTING RANGE***
Create a function that will calculate the chances of the user blocking or dodging an incoming attack.
      Using an Integer, ranging from (0-9), we will use a random number generator to test if the chracter will dodge.
